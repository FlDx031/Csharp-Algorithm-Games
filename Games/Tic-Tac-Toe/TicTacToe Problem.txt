Objective: Create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C# that allows two players to play against each other. The program should track the board state, allow players to take turns, and determine when there is a winner or a draw.

Requirements:

1) Implement a 3x3 game board.
2) Allow two players (Player X and Player O) to take turns placing their marks on the board.
3) Ensure a valid move:
	- Players can only mark an empty cell.
	- Players cannot overwrite each other’s moves.
4) Check for a winner:
	- A player wins if they have 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
5) Declare a draw if the board is full and there is no winner.
6) Print the game board after each turn.
