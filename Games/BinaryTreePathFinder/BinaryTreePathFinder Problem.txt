Write a function that finds all paths from the root to the leaves of a binary tree. Each path should be represented as a list of values, starting from the root and ending at a leaf. The output should be a collection of all such paths.

For a given tree : 

        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6

The paths are:

[1, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 5]
[1, 3, 6]

The outpout should be: 

[[1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 6]]
